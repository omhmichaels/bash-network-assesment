## Networking Fundamentals Homework: Rocking your Network!

You have just been hired by RockStar Corporation as a network security analyst.

- RockStar Corp has recently built a new office in Hollywood, California. You are tasked with completing a **network vulnerability assessment** of the office.

- You will complete several steps in order to analyze the Hollywood network and then provide RockStar Corp a summary of your findings.

- RockStar Corp is also concerned that a hacker may have infiltrated their Hollywood office. You will need to determine if there is anything suspicious in your findings.

### Files Required 

RockStar Corp has provided you with:

### Network Vulnerability Assessment Instructions

### **Phase 1**: _"I'd like to Teach the World to `Ping`"_

You have been provided a list of network assets belonging to RockStar Corp. Use `fping` to ping the network assets for only the Hollywood office.

  - Determine the IPs for the Hollywood office and run `fping` against the IP ranges in order to determine which IP is accepting connections.

  - RockStar Corp doesn't want any of their servers, even if they are up, indicating that they are accepting connections.

  - Create a summary file in a word document that lists out the `fping` command used, as well as a summary of the results.

  - Your summary should determine which IPs are accepting connections and which are not. 

  - Also indicate at which OSI layer your findings are found.


### **Phase 2**:  _"Some `Syn` for Nothin`"_

With the IP(s) found from Phase 1, determine which ports are open:

  - You will run a `SYN SCAN` against the IP accepting connections. See **SYN SCAN Instructions** below.

  - Using the results of the `SYN SCAN`, determine which ports are accepting connections. 

  - Add these findings to the summary and be sure to indicate at which OSI layer your findings were found.
  
#### `SYN SCAN`  Instructions
  
What is **Nmap**? 

  - **Nmap** is a free networking scanning tool available on Kali Linux.

  - Security professionals use Nmap to determine the devices running on a network, as well as finding open ports to determine potential security vulnerabilities.

  - Nmap has many capabilities and commands that can be run. Here is a cheat sheet for reference:  https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/.

For this activity, we will specifically focus on the Nmap capability of running a SYN SCAN.

  - We have already covered that a SYN SCAN is an automated method to check for the states of ports on a network, Nmap is simply a tool that can automate this task.

To run a SYN SCAN:

  - Open up your terminal within Kali Linux.

  - The command to run a SYN SCAN is `nmap -sS  <IP Address>`.

    - For example, if you wanted to run a SYN SCAN against the server IP of `74.207.244.221`, you would run `nmap -sS 74.207.244.221` and press enter.

    - This will scan the most common 1000 ports.
  
  - After this runs for several minutes, it should return a similar result that depicts the state of the ports on that server: 
        
        Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-08-14 11:51 EDT
        Nmap scan report for li86-221.members.linode.com (74.207.244.221)
        Host is up (1.4s latency).
        Not shown: 988 closed ports
        PORT    STATE    SERVICE
        22/tcp  open     ssh
        25/tcp  filtered smtp
        110/tcp open     pop3
        113/tcp filtered ident
        135/tcp filtered msrpc
        139/tcp filtered netbios-ssn
        143/tcp open     imap
        445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds
        465/tcp open     smtps
        587/tcp open     submission
        993/tcp open     imaps
        995/tcp open     pop3s

  - The results show the port number / TCP / UDP , the state of the port, and the service / protocol for the ports that are either open or filtered (stopped by a firewall).

  - Closed ports are not shown, indicated on the line:  `Not shown: 988 closed ports`.

  - For the purpose of this exercise, document which ports are open.

  

### Phase 3: _"I Feel a `DNS` Change Comin' On"_

With your findings from Phase 2, determine if you can access the server that is accepting connections.
  
- RockStar typically uses the same default username and password for most of their servers, so try this first:

  - **Username:**   `jimi`

  - **Password:**   `hendrix`
  
RockStar Corp recently reported that they are unable to access `rollingstone.com` in the Hollywood office. Sometimes when they try to access the website, a different, unusual website comes up. 
  
  - Determine if something was modified on this system to affect the viewing of `rollingstone.com`.
  
  - Use `Nslookup` to determine which website `rollingstone.com` is being redirected to.

    - **Nslookup** is a command line utility that can work in Windows or Linux Systems. It is designed to query the Domain Name System.
    
    - To run Nslookup, simply enter the following on the command line:
    
      `nslookup   <IP Address>   OR  nslookup <domainname>`
        
  - Add your findings to your summary and be sure to indicate at which OSI layer they were found.
 
 ### Phase 4:  _"Sh`ARP` Dressed Man"_
 
On this same server, in the same directory as the last file from Phase 3, the hacker left a note as to where he stored away some packet captures.  
   
- These are packets that were captured from activity in the Hollywood Office.

- Use Wireshark to analyze these pcap files and determine if there was any suspicious activities related to a hacker.

  - **Hint**: Focus on the ARP and HTTP protocols.

- Add your findings in your summary, and be sure to indicate at which OSI layer they were found.
   
### Your Submission:  _"Its the End of the Assessment as We Know It, and I Feel Fine"_
 
#### Guidelines for your Submission:
  
Provide the following for each phase: 

  - List the steps and commands used to complete the tasks.

  - List any vulnerabilities discovered.
  
  - List any findings associated to a hacker.
  
  - Document the mitigation recommendations to protect against the discovered vulnerabilities.
  
  - Document the OSI layer where the findings were found. 
  

For example:
  
**Phase 1**

- Determined the IP ranges to scan were `1.1.1.1` and `2.2.2.2`, then ran `fping` against `1.1.1.1` and `2.2.2.2`.
  
  - Used the following commands to run `fping`:
    
    - `fping 1.1.1.1 `

- Determined a potential vulnerability that IP `1.1.1.1` is responding. 
  
  - Since RockStar Corp doesn't want to respond to any requests, this is a vulnerability.

- Recommend to restrict allowing ICMP echo requests against IP `1.1.1.1` to prevent successful responses from PING requests.

- This occurred on the network layer as Ping uses IP addresses and IPs are used on the Network Layer.
